"I think you should not try to plot the change. 
What I would like to see as a reviewer is a lineplot or a
barplot that shows me the sum for each year. 
I then can see the change by seeing the line or 
the bars going up and down over those years. 
If we would not have to draw a plot, a simple list like:
  
  1999: 1855
2002: 2040
2005: 1930
2008: 1670
(numbers completely made up)

would be sufficient.
I can see the change over the years from those numbers.
In this example it goes up in 2002 and then it goes
down over the next years. 
More rapidly between 2005 and 2008 than between 2002 and 2005.
